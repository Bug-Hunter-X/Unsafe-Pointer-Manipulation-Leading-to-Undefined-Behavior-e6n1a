This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: unsafe pointer manipulation that leads to undefined behavior.  The `bug.rs` file showcases the problematic code. The solution is to avoid direct pointer manipulation wherever possible, opting for safe Rust idioms. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected, safer version.  This example highlights the importance of safe Rust practices and understanding memory management.
